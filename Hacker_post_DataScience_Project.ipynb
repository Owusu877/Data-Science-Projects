    "# Data Science Project: Exploring Hackers News Posts \n",
    "\n",
    "Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit.Hence in this project, we'll compare two different types of posts from Hacker News.Since we are interested in posts with titles begining with Ask HN and show HN, we'll explore posts that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, such as \"How to improve my personal website?\" Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll specifically compare these two types of posts to determine the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average? \n",
    "2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the data set we're working with was reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions."
